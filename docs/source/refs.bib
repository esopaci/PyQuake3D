@article{ben-zion-2023,
	abstract = {{We examine localization processes of low magnitude seismicity in relation to the occurrence of large earthquakes using three complementary analyses: (i) estimated production of rock damage by background events, (ii) evolving occupied fractional area of background seismicity and (iii) progressive coalescence of individual earthquakes into clusters. The different techniques provide information on different time scales and on the spatial extent of weakened damaged regions. Techniques (i) and (ii) use declustered catalogues to avoid the occasional strong fluctuations associated with aftershock sequences, while technique (iii) examines developing clusters in entire catalogue data. We analyse primarily earthquakes around large faults that are locked in the interseismic periods, and examine also as a contrasting example seismicity from the creeping Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault. Results of analysis (i) show that the M \\&gt; 7 Landers 1992, Hector Mine 1999, El Mayor-Cucapah 2010 and Ridgecrest 2019 main shocks in Southern and Baja California were preceded in the previous decades by generation of rock damage around the eventual rupture zones. Analysis (ii) reveals localization (reduced fractional area) 2--3 yr before these main shocks and before the M \\&gt; 7 D{\"u}zce 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Results with technique (iii) indicate that individual events tend to coalesce rapidly to clusters in the final 1--2 yr before the main shocks. Corresponding analyses of data from the Parkfield region show opposite delocalization patterns and decreasing clustering before the 2004 M6 earthquake. Continuing studies with these techniques, combined with analysis of geodetic data and insights from laboratory experiments and model simulations, might improve the ability to track preparation processes leading to large earthquakes.}},

@article{bletery2023,
	abstract = {The existence of an observable precursory phase of slip on the fault before large earthquakes has been debated for decades. Although observations preceding several large earthquakes have been proposed as possible indicators of precursory slip, these observations do not directly precede earthquakes, are not seen before most events, and are also commonly observed without being followed by earthquakes. We conducted a global search for short-term precursory slip in GPS data. We summed the displacements measured by 3026 high-rate GPS time series---projected onto the directions expected from precursory slip at the hypocenter---during 48 hours before 90 (moment magnitude ‚â•7) earthquakes. Our approach reveals a ‚âà2-hour-long exponential acceleration of slip before the ruptures, suggesting that large earthquakes start with a precursory phase of slip, which improvements in measurement precision and density could more effectively detect and possibly monitor. Unlike some volcanic eruptions, no clear set of precursor signals have been identified for large earthquakes. Bletery and Nocquet analyzed high-rate GPS time series before 90 different earthquakes that were magnitude 7 and above to find a precursor signal (see the Perspective by B{\"u}rgmann). They observed a subtle signal that rose from the noise about 2 hours before these major earthquakes occurred. This work may allow fault monitoring for this precursor phase with denser and higher-precision instrumentation. ---Brent Grocholski High-time-rate GPS time series have a precursor signal for large earthquake rupture starting approximately 2 hours beforehand.},

@article{annurevRoeloffs,
	abstract = {Abstract For ten earthquakes in nonmagmatic settings, there are credible published accounts of pre-earthquake deformation-rate changes lasting hundreds of seconds to more than a decade. Although most M &gt; 7.5 earthquakes have occurred without detectable pre-earthquake deformation, the detection threshold for aseismic deformation remains high, in that aseismic slip with moment equivalent to an M5 earthquake would in most (although not all) cases have been missed. Interseismic deformation rates vary without being followed by earthquakes, and a strain-rate change prior to the 1989 Mw6.9 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake is shown to be similar in size to many other rate changes that have occurred since that time. Most examples of pre-earthquake aseismic deformation lasting hundreds of seconds or more probably originate adjacent to, or downdip of, the seismic rupture plane, rather than within the zone that undergoes seismic failure.},

	abstract = {Understanding the response of faults to the injection of high-pressure fluids is important for several subsurface applications, for example, geologic carbon sequestration or energy storage. Lab-based experiments suggest that fluid injection can activate fault slip and that this slip can lead to increased fluid transmission along low-permeability faults. Here we present in situ observations from a cross-borehole fluid-injection experiment in a low-permeability shale-bearing fault, which show fault displacement occurring before fluid-pressure build-up. Comparing these observations with numerical models with differing permeability evolution histories, we find that the observed variation in fluid pressure is best explained by a change in permeability only after the fault fails and slips beyond the pressurized area. Once fluid migration occurs along the fault as a result of slip-induced permeability increase, the fault experiences further opening due to a decrease in the effective normal stress. We suggest that decoupling of fault slip and opening, leading to a rapid increase in fluid pressurization following the initial fault slip, could be an efficient driver for fluid migration in low-permeability faults.},

@article{dalzilio2022hydro,
	abstract = {A major goal in earthquake physics is to derive a constitutive framework for fault slip that captures the dependence of shear strength on fault rheology, sliding velocity, and pore-fluid pressure. In this study, we present H-MEC (Hydro-Mechanical Earthquake Cycles), a newly-developed two-phase flow numerical framework --- which couples solid rock deformation and pervasive fluid flow --- to simulate how crustal stress and fluid pressure evolve during the earthquake cycle. This unified, continuum-based model, incorporates a staggered finite difference--marker-in-cell method and accounts for inertial wave-mediated dynamics and fluid flow in poro-visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. Global Picard-iterations and an adaptive time stepping allow the correct resolution of both long- and short-time scales, ranging from years to milliseconds. We present a comprehensive in-plane strike-slip setup in which we test analytical poroelastic benchmarks of pore-fluid pressure diffusion from an injection point along a finite fault width. We then investigate how pore-fluid pressure evolution and solid--fluid compressibility control sequences of seismic and aseismic fault slip. While the weakening phase is controlled by localized compaction of pores and dynamic self-pressurization of fluids inside the undrained fault zone, the subsequent propagation of dynamic ruptures is driven by pore-pressure waves. Furthermore, pore-fluid pressure conditions on the fault and shear strength weakening associated with rapid self-pressurization of fluids control the characteristic slip-weakening distance, the final size of seismic events, and the scaling between slip and fracture energy observed for large earthquakes. Our modeling results demonstrate that fault failure can occur due to poroelastic coupling on a finite-width shear zone, thus highlighting the importance of considering the realistic hydro-mechanical structure of faults to investigate fluid-driven seismic and aseismic slip, either as a natural process or induced by human activities.},

	abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional (2-D) thermo-mechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a nonlinear visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction law and an adaptive time-stepping, which allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. Long-term tectonic convergence is imposed by displacing a boundary at a constant rate, whereas temperature-dependent viscosity is solved using a rapidly-converging Newton-Raphson scheme. The 2-D volume is discretized using finite differences on a fully staggered grid and marker-in-cell techniques. An adaptive free-surface approximation is used to modulate the air viscosity with the time step, which allows stresses to vanish on the free surface during the propagation of fast slipping events. We present a set of increasingly complex models in which we investigate how inertia, radiation damping, thermally activated nonlinear rheology, and off-megathrust splay-fault events affect sequences of seismic and aseismic slip on a simplified subduction megathrust. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyze earthquake sequences and to connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations spanning from slow interseismic strain accumulation to localized coseismic slip of individual earthquakes and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation.}},

	abstract = {Orogenic degassing is emerging as a potentially relevant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the continental crust. However, the processes of carbon mobilization are still poorly explored. Here, we use thermodynamic modeling to investigate the decarbonation of sediments metamorphosed under high geothermal gradients. Our modeling shows that immiscible CO2-rich vapors and hydrosaline brines are generated at these conditions, with different properties and mobility through the crust. The CO2-rich fluid fraction could rapidly rise toward the surface without interacting with the host rocks by carbo-fracturing the host rocks or through deep faults. The denser hydrosaline brines likely permeate the source rocks. When applied to the active Himalayan orogen, these observations reconcile measured CO2 fluxes at the surface and positive conductivity anomalies associated with micro-seismicity at depth. Our modeling shows that the continental crust represents a relevant reservoir of CO2 that can be efficiently degassed during hot collisions.},

	abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional (2-D) thermo-mechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a nonlinear visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction law and an adaptive time-stepping, which allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. Long-term tectonic convergence is imposed by displacing a boundary at a constant rate, whereas temperature-dependent viscosity is solved using a rapidly-converging Newton-Raphson scheme. The 2-D volume is discretized using finite differences on a fully staggered grid and marker-in-cell techniques. An adaptive free-surface approximation is used to modulate the air viscosity with the time step, which allows stresses to vanish on the free surface during the propagation of fast slipping events. We present a set of increasingly complex models in which we investigate how inertia, radiation damping, thermally activated nonlinear rheology, and off-megathrust splay-fault events affect sequences of seismic and aseismic slip on a simplified subduction megathrust. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyze earthquake sequences and to connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations spanning from slow interseismic strain accumulation to localized coseismic slip of individual earthquakes and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation.}},

@article{velo2cycles,
	abstract = {{We present a two-dimensional (2-D) thermo-mechanical computational framework for simulating earthquake sequences in a nonlinear visco-elasto-plastic compressible medium. The method is developed for a plane-strain problem and incorporates an invariant formulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction law and an adaptive time-stepping, which allows the time step to vary by many orders of magnitude during a simulation. Long-term tectonic convergence is imposed by displacing a boundary at a constant rate, whereas temperature-dependent viscosity is solved using a rapidly-converging Newton-Raphson scheme. The 2-D volume is discretized using finite differences on a fully staggered grid and marker-in-cell techniques. An adaptive free-surface approximation is used to modulate the air viscosity with the time step, which allows stresses to vanish on the free surface during the propagation of fast slipping events. We present a set of increasingly complex models in which we investigate how inertia, radiation damping, thermally activated nonlinear rheology, and off-megathrust splay-fault events affect sequences of seismic and aseismic slip on a simplified subduction megathrust. The new method provides a unique computational framework to analyze earthquake sequences and to connect forearc deformation with the dynamic properties of the megathrust, thus providing a physical link between observations spanning from slow interseismic strain accumulation to localized coseismic slip of individual earthquakes and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation.}},

@article{Kato:2020aa,
	abstract = {Despite decades of observational, laboratory and theoretical studies, the processes leading to large earthquake generation remain enigmatic. However, recent observations provide new promising perspectives that advance knowledge. Here, we review data on the initiation processes of large earthquakes and show that they are multiscale and diverse, involving localization of deformation, fault heterogeneities and variable local loading rate effects. Analyses of seismic and geodetic data reveal evidence for regional weakening by earthquake-induced rock damage and progressive localization of deformation around the eventual rupture zones a few years before some large earthquakes. The final phase of deformation localization includes, depending on conditions, a mixture of slow slip transients and foreshocks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The evolution of slip on large, localized faults shows a step-like increase that might reflect stress loading by previous failures, which can produce larger dynamic slip, in contrast to the smooth acceleration expected for a growing aseismic nucleation phase. We propose an integrated model to explain the diversity of large earthquake generation from progressive volumetric deformation to localized slip, which motivates future near-fault seismic and geodetic studies with dense sensor networks and improved analysis techniques that can resolve multiscale processes.},

It is a collaborative project between academia and industry that aims to characterize the stress pattern and to understand the stress sources. It commenced in 1986 as a project of the International Lithosphere Program under the leadership of Mary-Lou Zoback. From 1995-2008 it was a project of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities headed first by Karl Fuchs and then by Friedemann Wenzel. Since 2009 the WSM is maintained at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences and since 2012 the WSM is a member of the ICSU World Data System.All stress information is analysed and compiled in a standardized format and quality-ranked for reliability and comparability on a global scale. The stress map displays A-C quality stress data records of the upper 40 km of the Earth's crust from the WSM database release 2016 (doi:10.5880/WSM.2016.001). Focal mechanism solutions determined as being potentially unreliable (labelled as Possible Plate Boundary Events in the database) are not displayed. Further detailed information on the WSM quality ranking scheme, guidelines for the various stress indicators, and software for stress map generation and the stress pattern analysis is available at http://www.world-stress-map.org.},

	abstract = {We employ a computationally efficient fault system earthquake simulator, RSQSim, to explore effects of earthquake nucleation and fault system geometry on earthquake occurrence. The simulations incorporate rate- and state-dependent friction, high-resolution representations of fault systems, and quasi-dynamic rupture propagation. Faults are represented as continuous planar surfaces, surfaces with a random fractal roughness, and discontinuous fractally segmented faults. Simulated earthquake catalogs have up to 102 earthquakes that span a magnitude range from $\sim$M4.5 to M8. The seismicity has strong temporal and spatial clustering in the form of foreshocks and aftershocks and occasional large-earthquake pairs. Fault system geometry plays the primary role in establishing the characteristics of stress evolution that control earthquake recurrence statistics. Empirical density distributions of earthquake recurrence times at a specific point on a fault depend strongly on magnitude and take a variety of complex forms that change with position within the fault system. Because fault system geometry is an observable that greatly impacts recurrence statistics, we propose using fault system earthquake simulators to define the empirical probability density distributions for use in regional assessments of earthquake probabilities.},

@article{Piccinini2014,
	abstract = {Within the central Mediterranean geodynamic puzzle, the seismotectonic processes of the northern sector of the Apennines are still under debate. In this framework, we conducted a careful examination of seismic catalogues for five years of instrumental seismicity located in the eastern sector of the ToscoEmiliano Apennines. In our study, we merge two separate seismic bulletins, derived from a small- and a large-aperture seismic network. The joint analysis of the seismic phases of both catalogues allows us to improve event locations and to assess their hypocentral depths. After re-location using a regional velocity model, we found that the spatial distribution of hypocenters follows characteristic patterns at the southwestern and northeastern sides of the chain. Such distribution exhibits a marked axial offset in correspondence of the Livorno-Sillaro Line (LSL), a NE-SW trending lithological discontinuity previously interpreted in terms of a transform zone. Basing on this evidence, and on additional observations related to the morphology of the area, we hypothesise the LSL to represent the shallow manifestation of a discontinuity affecting the whole lithospheric thickness, i.e. a incipient tear fault dislocating the subducting slab.},

	abstract = {The foreland regional monocline related to the northern Apennines subduction can be followed from the Po Basin to the Friuli region, Italy, at least 240 km north-eastward. In seismic reflection profiles of the Po Basin and of the northern Adriatic Sea, the dip of the regional monocline gradually decreases from about 22$^\circ$ to close to 0$^\circ$. Pleistocene sediments onlap and pinchout to the northeast. Venice is located on a segment of the active monocline dipping about 1.8$^\circ$ to the southwest. In sediments around the Venice area, the 1.43 Ma limit is in the 960\textendash{}1500 m depth range, indicating a long term subsidence rate of about 0.7\textendash{}1.0 mm/yr. Therefore a significant part of the natural component of the town subsidence is related to the north-eastward retreat of the Adriatic subduction. The subduction related downflexure affects the whole of the Po Plain basin and part of the Southern Alps, where it opposes to the general uplift related to orogenesis.},

	abstract = {The INGV-Harvard European-Mediterranean Regional Centroid Moment Tensor (RCMT) Catalog collects solutions routinely computed since 1997 for earthquakes with moderate magnitude (4.5$\leq$M$\leq$5.5) in the Mediterranean region. The database represents an extension to smaller magnitudes of the Harvard global CMT catalog, based on analysis of seismograms recorded at regional distance, and modeling of intermediate period surface waves. The catalog includes about 600 events, 200 of which in the Italian region. This study extends the catalog back in time, for the Italian region, as long as made possible by available digital data \textendash{} i.e. since 1977 \textendash{} with the same analysis and inversion method used for current seismicity. As a result, we present here 65 new moment tensors, for years between 1977 and 1997. These solutions represent 45\% of the total number of events analyzed, the existing seismograms being often too scarce to allow a stable solution. The new dataset includes events in many seismic zones where moderate seismicity had previously been scarcely documented, e.g., the Po Plain, the Central to Southern Apennines and the Adriatic Sea. The complete dataset, including previously determined RCMTs and CMTs, represents the seismic deformation in the Italian area during the last 25 years.},

@article{Pasquale2013,
	abstract = {Temperatures recorded in wells as deep as 6km drilled for hydrocarbon prospecting were used together with geological information to depict the thermal regime of the sedimentary sequence of the eastern sector of the Po Plain. After correction for drilling disturbance, temperature data were analyzed through an inversion technique based on a laterally constant thermal gradient model. The obtained thermal gradient is quite low within the deep carbonate unit (14mKm-1), while it is larger (53mKm-1) in the overlying impermeable formations. In the uppermost sedimentary layers, the thermal gradient is close to the regional average (21mKm-1). We argue that such a vertical change cannot be ascribed to thermal conductivity variation within the sedimentary sequence, but to deep groundwater flow. Since the hydrogeological characteristics (including litho-stratigraphic sequence and structural setting) hardly permit forced convection, we suggest that thermal convection might occur within the deep carbonate aquifer. The potential of this mechanism was evaluated by means of the Rayleigh number analysis. It turned out that permeability required for convection to occur must be larger than 3 10-15m2. The average over-heat ratio is 0.45. The lateral variation of hydrothermal regime was tested by using temperature data representing the aquifer thermal conditions. We found that thermal convection might be more developed and variable at the Ferrara High and its surroundings, where widespread fracturing may have increased permeability. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The newly estimated temperature is 1830$\pm$48K, 70K higher than that by our previous estimation. The EoSes of the major mantle minerals (olivine, wadsleyite, ringwoodite and perovskite) are also recalculated using the Tange scale. The adiabatic temperature gradient is calculated using the thermal expansion coefficient obtained from these EoSes. The adiabatic temperature gradient gradually decreases with increasing depth without a phase transition, and abruptly increases in association with phase transitions. The adiabatic temperature gradients are found to be 04\textendash{}0.5 and 0.3K/km in the upper and lower parts of the mantle, respectively. The temperatures at a depth of 200km, the bottom of the mantle transition zone, the top of the lower mantle and a depth of 2700km are found to be 1720$\pm$40, 2010$\pm$40, 1980$\pm$40, and 2730$\pm$50K.

	abstract = {This paper presents a velocity model of the Italian (central Mediterranean) lithosphere in unprecedented detail. The model is derived by inverting a set of 166,000 P-g and P-n seismic wave arrival times, restricted to the highest-quality data available. The tomographic images reveal the geometry of the subduction-collision system between the European, Adriatic, and Tyrrhenian plates, over a larger volume and with finer resolution than previous studies. We find two arcs of low-V-p anomalies running along the Alps and the Apennines, describing the collision zones of underthrusting continental lithospheres. Our results suggest that in the Apennines, a significant portion of the crust has been subducted below the mountain belt. From the velocity model we can also infer thermal softening of the crustal wedge above the subducting Adriatic plate. In the Tyrrhenian back-arc region, strong and extensive low-V-p anomalies depict upwelling asthenospheric material. The tomographic images also allow us to trace the boundary between the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian plates at Moho depth, revealing some tears in the Adriatic-Ionian subducting lithosphere. The complex lithospheric structure described by this study is the result of a long evolution; the heterogeneities of continental margins, lithospheric underthrusting, and plate indentation have led to subduction variations, slab tears, and asthenospheric upwelling at the present day. The high-resolution model provided here greatly improves our understanding of the central Mediterranean's structural puzzle. The results of this study can also shed light on the evolution of other regions experiencing both oceanic and continental subduction.},

@article{Spada2013,
	abstract = {The accurate definition of 3-D crustal structures and, in primis, the Moho depth, are the most important requirement for seismological, geophysical and geodynamic modelling in complex tectonic regions. In such areas, like the Mediterranean region, various active and passive seismic experiments are performed, locally reveal information on Moho depth, average and gradient crustal Vp velocity and average Vp/Vs velocity ratios. Until now, the most reliable information on crustal structures stems from controlled-source seismology experiments. In most parts of the Alpine region, a relatively large number of controlled-source seismology information are available though the overall coverage in the central Mediterranean area is still sparse due to high costs of such experiments. Thus, results from other seismic methodologies, such as local earthquake tomography, receiver functions and ambient noise tomography can be used to complement the controlled-source seismology information to increase coverage and thus the quality of 3-D crustal models. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to directly combine controlled-source seismology and receiver functions information relying on the strengths of each method and in relation to quantitative uncertainty estimates for all data to derive a well resolved Moho map for Italy. To obtain a homogeneous elaboration of controlled-source seismology and receiver functions results, we introduce a new classification/weighting scheme based on uncertainty assessment for receiver functions data. In order to tune the receiver functions information quality, we compare local receiver functions Moho depths and uncertainties with a recently derived well-resolved local earthquake tomography-derived Moho map and with controlled-source seismology information. We find an excellent correlation in the Moho information obtained by these three methodologies in Italy. In the final step, we interpolate the controlled-source seismology and receiver functions information to derive the map of Moho topography in Italy and surrounding regions. Our results show high-frequency undulation in the Moho topography of three different Moho interfaces, the European, the Adriatic-Ionian, and the Liguria-Corsica-Sardinia-Tyrrhenia, reflecting the complexity of geodynamical evolution.},

@article{Conrad2004,
	abstract = {Great earthquakes, the few largest earthquakes that account for most of the Earth's seismic energy release, have occurred at only a few subduction zones around the world. Strong locking, or `seismic coupling', of the interface between plates at certain subduction zones is often invoked to explain these great earthquakes. Although past studies have correlated strong seismic coupling with a compressional stress environment that is characterized by back-arc compression and caused by trenchward motion of the overriding plate, the consequences of this compressional environment for the tectonic forces that drive global plate motions are not yet clear. To examine these consequences, we compared subduction zone earthquake magnitudes to tectonically constrained estimates of the degree to which each slab transmits its excess weight as a direct pull force on a subducting plate. At seismically uncoupled subduction zones that generate only moderate-sized earthquakes, we find that slabs must transmit nearly their entire upper mantle weight as a pull force on the subducting plate. At seismically coupled subduction zones that produce great earthquakes, however, we find that slabs must be nearly completely detached from their subducting plates. This suggests that slabs subducting in a compressional environment experience stress-induced weakening that prevents the effective transmission of the slab pull force. Convergent mantle flow above a descending slab that becomes decoupled from its surface plate may induce additional surface compression that further locks the subduction zone and leads to additional slab decoupling and detachment. The resulting redistribution of plate-driving forces may be responsible for rapid changes in plate motion.},

@article{Mantovani2015a,
	abstract = {In previous papers, we have argued that a close connection may exist between the discontinuous northward displacement of the Adria plate and the spatio-temporal distribution of major earthquakes in the periAdriatic regions [1]-[3]. In particular, five seismic sequences are tentatively recognized in the post 1400 A.D. seismic history, each characterized by a progressive migration of major shocks along the eastern (Hellenides, Dinarides), western (Apennines) and northern (Eastern Southern Alps) boundaries of Adria. In this work, we describe an attempt at gaining insights into the short-term evolution of the strain field that underlies the migration of seismicity in the Apennine belt. The results of this study suggest that seismicity in the study area is mainly conditioned by the fact that the outer (Adriatic) sector of the Apennine belt, driven by the Adria plate, is moving faster than the inner (Tyrrhenian) belt. This kinematics is consistent with the observed Pleistocene deformation pattern and the velocity field inferred by GPS data. The spatio-temporal distribution of major shocks during the last still ongoing seismic sequence (post 1930) suggests that at present the probability of next major shocks is highest in the Northern Apennines. Within this area, we suggest that seismic hazard is higher in the zones located around the outer sector of the Romagna-Marche-Umbria units (RMU), since that wedge is undergoing an accelerated relative motion with respect to the inner Apennine belt. This hypothesis may also account for the pattern of background seismicity in the Northern Apennines. This last activity might indicate that the Upper Tiber Valley fault system is the most resisted boundary sector of the RMU mobile wedge, implying an higher probability of major earthquakes.},

@article{Cheloni2016,
	abstract = {Here we present the results of the inversion of a new geodetic data set covering the 2012 Emilia seismic sequence and the following 1 year of postseismic deformation. Modeling of the geodetic data together with the use of a catalog of 3-D relocated aftershocks allows us to constrain the rupture geometries and the coseismic and postseismic slip distributions for the two main events (Mw 6.1 and 6.0) of the sequence and to explore how these thrust events have interacted with each other. Dislocation modeling reveals that the first event ruptured a slip patch located in the center of the Middle Ferrara thrust with up to 1 m of reverse slip. The modeling of the second event, located about 15 km to the southwest, indicates a main patch with up to 60 cm of slip initiated in the deeper and flatter portion of the Mirandola thrust and progressively propagated postseismically toward the top section of the rupture plane, where most of the aftershocks and afterslip occurred. Our results also indicate that between the two main events, a third thrust segment was activated releasing a pulse of aseismic slip equivalent to a Mw 5.8 event. Coulomb stress changes suggest that the aseismic event was likely triggered by the preceding main shock and that the aseismic slip event probably brought the second fault closer to failure. Our findings show significant correlations between static stress changes and seismicity and suggest that stress interaction between earthquakes plays a significant role among continental en echelon thrusts.},

We extend the results from previous studies based on analytical inversion modeling of GPS and RADARSAT-1 InSAR measurements by exploiting RADARSAT-2 data. Moreover, we benefit from the available large amount of geological and geophysical information through finite element method (FEM) modeling implemented in a structural-mechanical context to investigate the impact of known buried structures on the modulation of the ground deformation field. We find that the displacement pattern associated with the 20 May event is consistent with the activation of a single fault segment of the inner Ferrara thrust, in good agreement with the analytical solution. In contrast, the interpretation of the 29 May episode requires the activation of three different fault segments and a block roto-translation of the Mirandola anticline. The proposed FEM-based methodology is applicable to other seismic areas where the complexity of buried structures is known and plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the associated surface deformation pattern.},

@article{Chiarabba2014,
	abstract = {Recordings of teleseismic earthquakes from a dense set of temporary and permanent broadband seismic stations reveal the lithospheric structure of the northern Apennines and support the scenario of a retreating detachment within the mid-crust. Lithospheric delamination appears crucial to the formation and evolution of the Apennines orogen. Receiver-function (RF) stacks outline a continuous west-dipping Ps converted phase from a positive velocity jump that we interpret as the top of the lower crust and mantle of the Adria continental lithosphere, which is descending into the shallow mantle. The correlation of seismicity with two RF profiles across the northern Apennines suggests distinct stages of lithospheric delamination. Active penetration of the detachment into the Adria lithosphere seems evident in the south/east, with induced shallow-mantle flow facilitated by slab dehydration. Penetration of the detachment in the north/west seems to have arrested, and is possibly marked by crustal underplating. This layer atop the Apennines slab is visible only down to 80 km depth and suspends above an oppositely-dipping paired positive/negative Ps converted phase in stacked receiver functions. The break in the west-dipping Adria lithosphere conflicts with a westward-subduction scenario continuous from the Oligocene. Lateral changes of deep structure and seismicity along the northern Apennines suggest that underplating of crustal material and delamination-retreat are distinct mechanisms active today in the western and eastern sectors, respectively, of the northern Apennines. Negative Ps-pulses at 100-120 km depth help to define a seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), but cross-cut a volume of high-velocity mantle rock, as inferred from tomographic models. We hypothesize that this seismic LAB is a rheological discontinuity that affects the frequency band of seismic body waves, but not the long-term viscous response that governs the evolution and eventual detachment of the continental slab. \textcopyright{} 2014 .},

The time of increased exhumation rates coincides with onset of intramontane sedimentation, documenting a contribution of tectonics (local normal faulting?) to the surface uplift.

The GPS network maps the whole country with a mean inter-site distance of about 50km and provides a valuable source of data to study the ongoing deformation processes in the central Mediterranean. The estimated horizontal and vertical velocity fields show major significant features and also less known second-order kinematic features. A general uplift characterizes the whole Apennines and Alpine belts that follow the topographic ridge, whereas the Po Plain shows a gradually increasing subsidence from west to east. The Apennines belt displays a distinctive extension (50\textendash{}80 10-9yr-1) while compressive tectonic regimes characterize northern Sicily, eastern Alps and the northeast front of the northern Apennines (25\textendash{}50 10-9yr-1). Second-order deformation patterns, on large scale wavelength (\textasciitilde{}100km) have been detected on the accretionary prism of central and southern Apennines that are highly correlated with other geophysical data (Vp anomalies, seismic anisotropy, etc.) and related to deep rooted sections (70\textendash{}100km), marked by different subduction regimes. Apparently at this scale-length the observed deformations are governed by the lithosphere as a whole. We interpret these deformations as a result of different subduction mechanisms, such as variations of the subduction rollback velocity affecting different segments of the subduction zone and/or to mantle flows in proximity of the slab edges. Further south, in central-southern Sicily, we detect a contraction of (-1.1$\pm$0.2) mm/yr that probably accommodates part of the Africa\textendash{}Eurasia convergence on the outer thrust front of the Apennines\textendash{}Maghrebides belt. This hypothesis agrees with an independent analysis of the seismicity associated to the Sicilian Basal Thrust, thought to be still active.

	abstract = {The western Mediterranean subduction zone (WMSZ) extends from the northern Apennine to southern Spain and turns around forming the narrow and tight Calabrian and Gibraltar Arcs. The evolution of the WMSZ is characterized by a first phase of orogenic wedging followed, from 30 Ma on, by trench retreat and back-arc extension. Combining new and previous geological data, new tomographic images of the western Mediterranean mantle, and plate kinematics, we describe the evolution of the WMSZ during the last 35 Myr. Our reconstruction shows that the two arcs form by fragmentation of the 1500 km long WMSZ in small, narrow slabs. Once formed, these two narrow slabs retreat outward, producing back-arc extension and large scale rotation of the flanks, shaping the arcs. The Gibraltar Arc first formed during the middle Miocene, while the Calabrian Arc formed later, during the late Miocene-Pliocene. Despite the different paleogeographic settings, the mechanism of rupture and backward migration of the narrow slabs presents similarities on both sides of the western Mediterranean, suggesting that the slab deformation is also driven by lateral mantle flow that is particularly efficient in a restricted (upper mantle) style of mantle convection.},

@article{Serpelloni2006,
	abstract = {Geodetic data are providing a new prospective in studying active tectonic processes that are occurring in peninsular Italy. In this paper we use a recently published GPS velocity solution, obtained by merging a data set of permanent and non-permanent networks spanning the 1991-2002 time interval, to provide new quantitative constraints of the active deformation rates across the Apennines Chain and the Calabrian Arc. The velocity field, given with respect to a fixed Eurasian frame, has been used to compute horizontal strain-rates within polygonal regions that connect and include geodetic stations, and to draw velocity cross sections along 5 different profiles through this region. The computed strain-rates provide a picture of the regional deformation field, which is in agreement with other seismological and geological data, and show that the Apennines are mainly extending in a SW-NE direction, while in Calabria extension is NW-SE oriented. Indications of active shortening are present only in the outer Northern Apennines. The velocity profiles across the Northern and Southern Apennines, along the Tyrrhenian Sea and Calabria, provide a quantitative measurement of the active extension and shortening rates, which are taking up at a more local scale.},

@article{Chiaraluce2005,
	abstract = {The northern Apennines of Italy are characterized by a complex Tertiary tectonic history, where superposed compressional and extensional deformation occurred. In such regions, characterized by low active extensional strain rate, the coseismic surface ruptures are rare and often a matter of much debate resulting in a difficult connection between ``geological'' faults (i.e., faults which can be mapped at the surface) and ``seismological'' faults (i.e., faults which actually generate earthquakes). The availability of detailed geological mapping and high-resolution seismological data for the Colfiorito area, struck in 1997 by a sequence of six 5 $<$ Mw $\leq$ 6 normal faulting earthquakes, allow us to compare and verify the existence of geometric and kinematic correspondence between the mapped geological Quaternary faults and the activated structures. In map view, the earthquakes distribution reflects the fault pattern mapped at the surface, the length of activated and mapped faults is quite similar (7\textendash{}10 km), the coseismic subsided region imaged by interferometric synthetic aperture radar data, is located in the hanging wall of the mapped normal faults that bound the Quaternary basins. In section view, there is a geometric connection between mapped normal faults and the aftershock alignments used to image fault geometry at depth. Comparison of striated fault planes and aftershock focal mechanism solutions show a strong kinematic consistency. This study points out that the Quaternary tectonosedimentary evolution and the present-day geological and geomorphologic setting of the Colfiorito area can be interpreted as the result of repeated, extensional earthquakes, similar to the 1997 events, occurring on NW-SE trending normal faults. Our data also show that the main shocks of the Colfiorito sequence nucleated close to the intersections between the normal faults and the preexisting compressional/transpressional structures, which in 1997 acted as lateral barriers to rupture propagation and consequently constrained the fault size.},

@article{Sibson69,
	abstract = {Differential stress exerts both static and dynamic effects on rock-mass permeability, modulating fluid flow in the Earth{\textquoteright}s crust. Static stress fields impose a permeability anisotropy from stress-controlled features such as faults, extension fractures, and stylolites which, depending on the tectonic regime, may enhance, or counteract existing anisotropic permeability in layered rock sequences. Textural evidence from hydrothermal veins suggests, however, that fluid flow in fault-related fracture systems generally occurs episodically and that dynamic stress cycling effects are widespread. In the vicinity of active faults that undergo intermittent rupturing, permeability and fluid flux may be tied to the earthquake cycle through a range of mechanisms, leading to complex interactions between stress cycling, the creation and destruction of permeability, and fluid flow. Mechanisms for fluid redistribution include: (1) various forms of dilatancy (localized to the fault zone or extending through the surrounding rock mass) related to changes in shear stress and/or mean stress that occur during the fault loading cycle; (2) localized post-seismic redistribution around rupture irregularities, especially dilational jogs and bends which act as suction pumps; and (3) post-seismic discharge of fluids from overpressured portions of the crust through fault-valve action when ruptures breach impermeable barriers. All of these processes may be involved in fluid redistribution around active faults, but they operate to varying extents at different crustal levels, and in different tectonic regimes.},

	abstract = {The 1976 Friuli seismic sequence is known for itscomplexity, with several unusually large aftershocksoccurring in the epicentral area. The source region, where the northeastern part of the Alpine chain meetsthe northern Dinaric chain, is characterized by a complexcompressional tectonic regime. Previous studies have not clearly identified which of the two main tectonic systems was activated, in part due to the limited precision of derived earthquake parameters, such as hypocentral coordinates and focal mechanisms. We review the locations for the 10 largest events of the sequence, including theSeptember 16, 1977 and April 18, 1979 earthquakes andwe compute their centroid moment tensors. Source parameters are calculated using intermediate period surfacewaves and the modification of the Harvard centroid-moment tensoralgorithm proposed by Arvidsson and Ekstr{\"o}m (1998). A summary of all available geological, geodetic and seismological data show that most of the earthquakes may be associated with the Periadriatic overthrust and other related thrust faults. Based on their locations and focal mechanisms only two ofthe early aftershocks (May 7, 1976 and May 9, 1976) appear instead to have occurred on Dinaric structures.},

@article{jouanne11hima,
	abstract = {The 8 October 2005 Kashmir earthquake ruptured an out-of-sequence Himalayan thrust known as the Balakot-Bagh thrust. The earthquake's hypocenter was located at a depth of 15 km on the ramp close to a possible ramp/flat transition. In the weeks following the earthquake a GPS network was installed to measure postseismic displacement. The initial measurements in November 2005 were followed by other campaigns in January and August 2006, in March and December 2007, and in August 2008 and 2009. Two hypotheses were tested: post-seismic displacements controlled by viscous relaxation of the lower crust or by afterslip along a flat north of the ramp affected by the main shock. A single Newtonian viscosity for the different periods cannot be determined by numerical simulations of viscous relaxation, which may indicate that the viscosity of the lower crust is non-Newtonian or that viscous relaxation does not control postseismic displacements. Numerical simulations using dislocations in a uniform elastic half-space indicate afterslip north of the ramp of the earthquake along a flat connected to the ramp. Slip along the northwestern portion of the flat accrued to about 285 mm between November 2005 and August 2006, while slip along the southeastern portion accrued to 130 mm over the same time period. Residual misfit of the observed and predicted displacements clearly indicated that afterslip is a better explanation for the observations than the hypothesis of viscous relaxation. The time evolution of the afterslip was found to be consistent with that predicted from rate-strengthening frictional sliding.},

@article{robert2018RSF,
	abstract = {Abstract We present a 2-D numerical modeling approach for simulating a wide slip spectrum in a viscoelastoplastic continuum. The key new model component is an invariant reformulation of the classical rate- and state-dependent friction equations, which is designed for earthquake simulations along spontaneously evolving faults. Here we describe the methodology and demonstrate that it is accurate and stable in a setup consisting of a mature strike-slip fault zone. We show that the nucleation and propagation of an earthquake are well resolved, as supported by a good agreement with various analytical approximations, including those of the nucleation and cohesive zone lengths. Results generally converge with respect to grid size, time step, and other numerical parameters. The convergence rate with respect to grid size depends on the internodal averaging scheme, is influenced by wave reflections, and deteriorates for inclined faults. The simulated slip spectrum, ranging from stable sliding at the loading rate to periodic aseismic slip to periodic seismic slip as a function of nucleation size, is in general agreement with the literature. In this simple setup, dynamic pressure does not play a significant role. By analyzing the role of viscous deformation, we identify and confirm by our simulations a theoretical viscosity threshold below which earthquakes cannot nucleate. This threshold is shown to depend on the reference strength of rate- and state-dependent friction and the loading strain rate, which is in agreement with previous work on the brittle-ductile transition.},

@article{Christensen01021982,
	abstract = {Phase boundaries are included in dynamical finite element models of mantle convection. They are represented by point chains which act as additional sources of buoyancy forces when distorted, and as additional source or sink of heat. The influence of the exothermic olivine-spinel transition is studied in both shallow and deep convection models. The flow is only slightly enhanced by the transition. The increase of temperature due to latent heat release is step-like in the deep model, in the case of shallow convection it is more diffuse. Other quantities like ocean-floor topography, gravity anomalies, and stress distribution are no more than moderately affected. In a further investigation the effect of spinel post-spinel transition, whether endothermic or exothermic, on deep convection is examined. The effect on the flow is negligibly small in both cases.},
